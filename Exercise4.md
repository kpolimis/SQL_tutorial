# Exercise 4

In this exercise we will begin to explore spatial relationships with our dataset.

### Question to answer:
What is the most common crime within 5 km of my house?

#### Step 1: Find the coordinates of your house (or some other feature in the Seattle region).

* HINT: you can use google maps to find the latitude and longitude of any map location, e.g.:
